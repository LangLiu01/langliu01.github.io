      	<h2>For me,it's a long way to go.</h2>
<p>mom just threw me out of the house ,
She must be very upset and angry about the fact I have not find a job yet.Come on ,I just quit my last boring job for two weeks!</p>
<p>I don't know,she said I am very lazy and sleep all day and night and didn't do anything at all.
It's not true or it's half true, I do not have a job yet but that don't mean I didn't improve my programming skills or read the book,I don't like the opthion that she thought I have had read enough books in these years,she think I am useless.She care for me very much , I can't find a more kinder mom in earth than her,But she is trying to control my life and my career and  I hate it. I hate these talks between mom and me about that I can't do anything with programming,somehow I don't have many chioces
to choose where should I go and where I can stay.</p>
<p>I love my mom ,but I don't want to see her to be so sad for me for some reason that I can't understand ,she lived a tough life which means she worked so hard to raise me up to adult and I really want to say : Thanks mom,for so many years you care so much for me but please stop to rule my life and let me do what I want to do.Maybe mom just work too hard and feel too tired these days,she needs some rest.So maybe I should make fewer trouble for her,she spend too much time on me that she forget to care for herself,sorry mom,
I don't mean to be lazy , I just don't like these boring repeat worthless jobs,I want to programming , and this is the place where I can find myself with my mind and soul. </p>
