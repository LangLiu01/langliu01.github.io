					<p>Joanne is the fifth studio album by American singer Lady Gaga.
						The album era marked a change in Gaga's visual appearance, embodying a country-oriented look,
						 consisting mainly of a pink, wide-brimmed hat and usage of pastel colors, evoking the 1970s.
						 The singer's experience working on the television series American Horror Story influenced the creative process of Joanne,
						  and Gaga hearkened back to an authentic and simplistic presentation. To promote the album,
							three singles were released: "Perfect Illusion", "Million Reasons" and the title track.
							"Perfect Illusion" was released as the album's lead single on September 9, 2016,
							 and reached number one in France and Spain, while "Million Reasons" reached number four in the United States.
